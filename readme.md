# Technology Stack  #
---
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) -open-source JavaScript runtime environment 
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) -a web application framework for Node.js,
* [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/) -Database (Nosql)
* [NodeMailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) - Node module used for sending mails.
* [fast2sms Api](https://www.fast2sms.com/dashboard/sms/bulk)- Used for sending SMS.

# How it works?
1. *Firstly visitor checks in and his/her details are stored in the visitor db.*
2. *Then when he/she checks out, details from visitor db are removed and added into the checkout db.*
3. *After check-in the host gets an email and sms listing out the details of visitor.*
4. *Fast2Sms api used here only allows Non-DND numbers. DND numbers will not get any type of SMS.*
4. *While checking out, if the entered e-mail is not found in the visitor db then a message appears saying that the person needs to      checkin.*
5. *After check-out the visitor also gets an email listing out his/her visit details.*
6. *After every process the person is redirected to the landing page.*
